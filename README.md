# CPU-Raytracing-Reverb
CPU Raytracing Reverb is a Unity prototype for a tool that dynamically adapts
reverb parameters based on the environment. It uses Unity Raycasts to gather
data on the environmentâ€™s geometry and materials, allowing spatialized audio
to respond to these changes. For more details on the acoustic principles and
their implementation using ray tracing, check out the [documentation](./docs/Adaptive_Reverberation_in_Unity_Games-Albert_Madrenys.pdf).

This project uses Unity version 2022.3.12
